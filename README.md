# parsepdf

Try to learn rust and the PDF 2.0 spec by parsing PDFs with rust.

Recognizers for many objects writ.  Streams need a recognizer.
Some parsers also writ, but I feel they are not fully thought out yet.
I need to understand and come to terms with the nom consumer.
I need to organize the code better.
I need to learn all the things.
